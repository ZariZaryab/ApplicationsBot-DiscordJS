# ApplicationsBot-DiscordJS 
A simple discord JS bot (source code), mainly focused on easy applications without using any sort of database!

# SETUP
## Tidbits:
`Get your bot token using Google/YouTube`

`Go to developer mode in Discord to copy ids`
## Powering the bot:
> Open up `config.json` file and insert your bot token next to "TOKEN".

> Go to Discord, copy role id of any role you want (basically, users with this role can accept/reject) and insert in "REVIEWER_ROLE" `(in config.json file)`

> Go to Discord, copy channel id of any channel you want users to apply in (basically, you can have a record and no spam in other channels( and insert in "APPLY_ID" `(in config.json file)`

> Go to Discord, copy channel id of any channel you want the bot to send applications (basically, applications will be saved there) and insert in `(config.json file)`

# Features:
> Apply

> Accept

> Reject

> Clean,Simple use

I can make it much more complex by added database and stuff but, we'll go for simple one right now....
